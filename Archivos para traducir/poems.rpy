Calm; breathing air of the present but living in the past.\nThe light flickers.\nI flicker back."
    new "Los rizos de mi cabello se iluminan bajo el ámbar que resplandece,\nbañando.\nDebe ser este el que permanece.\nEl último farol que el tiempo no logró derribar,\nel único que aún no cambian por el frío azul verdemar.\nMe baño en su calma, respiro el presente, vivo el ayer.\nLa luz parpadea.\nParpadeo con él."

    # game/poems.rpy:24
    old "It happened in the dead of night while I was slicing bread for a guilty snack.\nMy attention was caught by the scuttering of a raccoon outside my window.\nThat was, I believe, the first time I noticed my strange tendencies as an unordinary human.\nI gave the raccoon a piece of bread, my subconscious well aware of the consequences.\nWell aware that a raccoon that is fed will always come back for more.\nThe enticing beauty of my cutting knife was the symptom.\nThe bread, my hungry curiosity.\nThe raccoon, an urge.\n\nThe moon increments its phase and reflects that much more light off of my cutting knife.\nThe very same light that glistens in the eyes of my raccoon friend.\nI slice the bread, fresh and soft. The raccoon becomes excited.\nOr perhaps I'm merely projecting my emotions onto the newly-satisfied animal.\n\nThe raccoon has taken to following me.\nYou could say that we've gotten quite used to each other.\nThe raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently, so my bread is always handy.\nEvery time I brandish my cutting knife, the raccoon shows me its excitement.\nA rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.\nAnd I feed myself again."
    new "Sucedió en plena noche mientras cortaba pan para un tentempié culpable.\nMi atención fue capturada por el ruido de un mapache fuera de mi ventana.\nEsa fue, creo, la primera vez que noté mis extrañas inclinaciones como un humano poco ordinario.\nLe di al mapache un trozo de pan, mi subconsciente plenamente consciente de las consecuencias.\nBien sabía que un mapache alimentado siempre volverá por más.\n\nLa belleza tentadora de mi cuchillo fue el síntoma.\nEl pan, mi curiosidad hambrienta.\nEl mapache, un impulso.\n\nLa luna avanza en su fase y refleja aún más luz en mi cuchillo.\nLa misma luz que brilla en los ojos de mi amigo mapache.\nCorto el pan, fresco y suave. El mapache se emociona.\nO tal vez solo proyecto mis emociones en el animal recién satisfecho.\n\nEl mapache ha comenzado a seguirme.\nPodría decirse que ya nos hemos acostumbrado el uno al otro.\nEl mapache tiene hambre cada vez más a menudo, así que siempre tengo pan a la mano.\nCada vez que levanto mi cuchillo, el mapache muestra su emoción.\nUn torrente de sangre. El clásico condicionamiento pavloviano. Corto el pan.\nY vuelvo a alimentarme."

    # game/poems.rpy:50
    old "A marvel millions of years in the making.\nWhere the womb of Earth chaotically meets the surface.\nUnder a clear blue sky, an expanse of bliss--\nBut beneath gray rolling clouds, an endless enigma.\nThe easiest world to get lost in\nIs one where everything can be found.\n\nOne can only build a sand castle where the sand is wet.\nBut where the sand is wet, the tide comes.\nWill it gently lick at your foundations until you give in?\nOr will a sudden wave send you crashing down in the blink of an eye?\nEither way, the outcome is the same.\nYet we still build sand castles.\n\nI stand where the foam wraps around my ankles.\nWhere my toes squish into the sand.\nThe salty air is therapeutic.\nThe breeze is gentle, yet powerful.\nI sink my toes into the ultimate boundary line, tempted by the foamy tendrils.\nTurn back, and I abandon my peace to erode at the shore.\nDrift forward, and I return to Earth forevermore."

    old "The tendrils of my hair illuminate beneath the amber glow.\nBathing.\nIn the distance, a blue-green light flickers.\nA lone figure crosses its path - a silhouette obstructing the eerie glow.\nMy heart pounds. The silhouette grows. Closer. Closer.\nI open my umbrella, casting a shadow to shield me from visibility.\nBut I am too late.\nHe steps into the streetlight. I gasp and drop my umbrella.\nThe light flickers. My heart pounds. He raises his arm.\n\nTime stops.\n\nThe only indication of movement is the amber light flickering against his outstretched arm.\nThe flickering light is in rhythm with the pounding of my heart.\nTeasing me for succumbing to this forbidden emotion.\nHave you ever heard of a ghost feeling warmth before?\nGiving up on understanding, I laugh.\nUnderstanding is overrated.\nI touch his hand. The flickering stops.\nGhosts are blue-green. My heart is amber."

I know I'm going to hate myself later for admitting that, but right now I don't care. I just feel so helpless. So please see if you can do something to help. I don't want anything bad to happen to her. I'll make you cupcakes if I have to. Just please try to do something.\n\nAs for Monika... I don't know why, but she's been really dismissive about this.
